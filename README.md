# Chess Blitz Slot Machine Game

Chess Blitz is a chess themed online slot machine game. The game has 5 reels and 3 rows, and the player can bet on up to 20 paylines. The symbols on the reels are the 12 chess pieces. The game also features 6 wild symbols each representing one of the chess pieces, that create wild fields and trigger a wild free spins bonus, and a scatter symbol, which triggers the chessboard bonus game.

## Bonus Features

The game features two bonus features:

- Wild Free Spins: When the player lands 3 or more wild symbols of any type, they trigger the wild free spins bonus round. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of wild symbols landed. During the free spins round, one of the 12 chess piece symbols is selected at random to become the wild. All instances of that symbol on the reels become wild and follow the rules for wilds of that kind.

- Chessboard Bonus Game: When the player lands 3 or more scatter symbols, they trigger the bonus game. In the bonus game, the player is presented with a chessboard and must select squares to reveal hidden prizes - if a player doesn't make a selection quickly a field is randomly selected for him. The game ends when the player selects a square that reveals the "RED FLAG" symbol or the "RED FLAG symbol" is revealed automatically. The sense of urgency is emphasized by a sound of a chess clock ticking, the bonus feature should emulate the feeling of playing a high stakes professional blitz chess game - the selections made being the "moves", the sound design should include crowd murmurs when low prizes are revealed and cheers when a big win is revealed.
